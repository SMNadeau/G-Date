# Opening App Initial Guide

### This guide assumes GDate-Beta is already installed via TestFlight 

1. After installation  on your IOS device you can open the app like any other.
2. Opening the application for the first time on a live device you will be greeted with a `Testers Notes` splash screen. This can be swiped away and will not present itself again. 
3. Next, you will be greeted with introduction pages to the application. Swipe through these and you will be greeted by the `Login Screen`
4. From here there are 3 paths to choose from
   1. **Login**: Select this if you already have registered an account within the GDate application. **This is not the same as being invited to beta test the application.**
   2. **Developer Mode**: This is for developers to skip a few of the screens for testing and may present some confusion. It is recommended to stay away from this page.
   3. **Sign Up**: **If you have not visited this screen prior please do so as a first stop** to get a new account set up. You will be presented with a passcode request before you can register a new account. The passcode as of right now is `0000`. Upon entering the code you will be presented with some more options, feel free to ignore ALL of them except **Register a new Account**.
      * Here you will select from the drop down to create a **participant** account and fill out the rest of the information with anything you would like __(Please ignore the final entry this is remnants of old code and will be cleaned up in future release)__. Also Note that your email can be anything you would like, fake or not, the only requirement is that it follows the pattern of __SomeText@Domain.com__ 
      * Once completed with the registration you will **__NOT__** be redirected to a new page. You can simply back out to the initial page found at point 4 above. This was done so Researchers could create many accounts without the requirement to re-navigate to the page again.
5. When you first log in to your new account you will be greeted by a welcome screen. On this screen you must do two things
   1. Upload and set a new image
   2. Fill out **__ALL__** of the "Profile Setup" screen
6. once step five is complete feel free to click all done and you will be moved to our "Swipe Screen". From here you can play with the app as you would like
